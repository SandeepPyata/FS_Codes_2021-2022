/*
A magic box with p rows and r columns is initially filled with silver.
If we invoke a method addMagicOperation which turns the silver at 
index(row, col) into gold. Given N set of indices to work up on, 
find the number of gold-blocks which are formed after each addMagicOperation. 

A gold-block is a block of gold cells connected horizontally and vertically 
and surrounded by silver. Consider all four edges of the magic box are 
surrounded by silver.

Input Format:
--------------
Line-1: Three space separated integers p, r , and n (number of add Magic Operations)
Next N lines: Two space separated integers, cell to perform addMagicOperation 

Output Format:
--------------
Print a list of numbers, number of gold-blocks formed after each addMagicOperation


Sample Input-1:
-----------------
3 3 5
0 0
0 1
1 2
2 1
1 1

Sample Output-1:
-----------------
[1, 1, 2, 3, 1]

Explanation:

Initially, the magic box is filled with silver. (Assume 0 represents silver and 1 represents gold).

0 0 0
0 0 0
0 0 0

Operation #1: addMagicOperation(0, 0) turns the silver at cell[0][0] into gold.

1 0 0
0 0 0   Number of Gold-blocks = 1
0 0 0

Operation #2: addMagicOperation(0, 1) turns the silver at cell[0][1] into gold.

1 1 0
0 0 0   Number of Gold-blocks = 1
0 0 0

Operation #3: addMagicOperation(1, 2) turns the silver at cell[1][2] into gold.

1 1 0
0 0 1   Number of Gold-blocks = 2
0 0 0

Operation #4: addMagicOperation(2, 1) turns the silver at cell[2][1] into gold.

1 1 0
0 0 1   Number of Gold-blocks = 3
0 1 0

Operation #5: addMagicOperation(1, 1) turns the silver at cell[1][1] into gold.

1 1 0
0 1 1   Number of Gold-blocks = 1
0 1 0
